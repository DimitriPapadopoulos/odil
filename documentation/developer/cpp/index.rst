C++ API
=======

The primary programming language of Odil is C++11: other languages (as :doc:`Python <../python/index>` or :doc:`Javascript <../javascript/index>`) are wrappers of the C++ code and try to mimic the C++ API. All classes, functions and variables of Odil are declared in the ``odil`` namespace. The include files reflect the classes: the ``odil::DataSet`` class will be declared in the ``odil/DataSet.h``. 

The full Doxygen reference is also `available`_.
