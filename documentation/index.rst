Welcome to Odil's documentation!
================================

*Odil* is a C++11 library for the `DICOM`_ standard.

Odil leverages C++ constructs to provide a user-friendly API of the different
parts of the DICOM standard. Included in Odil are:

- Reading and writing data sets with any transfer syntax
- Standard JSON and XML representation of datasets
- Clients and servers for the various DICOM protocols (C-FIND, C-GET, C-MOVE, C-STORE)
- Implementation of the DICOM web-services (WADO-RS, QIDO-RS, STOW-RS)
- Conversion to and from `DCMTK`_ data structures.

Odil builds and run on:

- Linux (Debian 8 and 9; Ubuntu 14.04, 16.04 and 18.04). Official packages are available in `Debian`_ and `Ubuntu`_, as well as `unofficial backports`_.
- macOS (a `Homebrew tap`_ is available)
- Windows
